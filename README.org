** Known issues
- =legit-to-word= does not work well in lines that mix variable-pitch and fixed-pitch faces.
- The overlays for =legit-to-word= and the cursor positions may differ by 1, depending on whether the character under the overlay is a space or a punctuation.
- Entering invalid keys doesn’t immediately break out of the command.  Press ~escape~ or ~C-g~ to exit instead.
- Frame’s workspace number is only available on linux systems running Xorg.
- On Linux systems running Xorg, frames are moved to the current workspace when switching with =legit-to-frame=.

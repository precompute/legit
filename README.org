Leg it across Emacs!  Frame, Window, Line, Word - traverse the hierarchy in just a few characters!

- =legit-to-word= :: Create overlays in current line and jump to a word.
- =legit-to-line= :: Create overlays in current buffer and jump to a line.
- =legit-to-window= :: Create overlays in visible windows on current frame and jump to one.
- =legit-to-frame= :: Collect information about available frames and jump to one with =completing-read=.
- =legit-from-frame= :: Leg It to a frame, then to a window, then to a line, and then to a word.
- =legit-from-window= :: Leg It to a window, then to a line, and then to a word.
- =legit-from-line= :: Leg It to a line, and then to a word.
  
** Known issues
- =legit-to-word= does not work well in lines that mix variable-pitch and fixed-pitch faces.
- The overlays for =legit-to-word= and the cursor positions may differ by 1, depending on whether the character under the overlay is a space or a punctuation.
- Frame’s workspace number is only available on linux systems running Xorg.
- On Linux systems running Xorg that do not have the =wmctrl= binary, frames are moved to the current workspace when switching with =legit-to-frame=.
- The =legit-from-*= functions chain =legit-to-*= functions.  There are no checks to see whether a =legit-to-*= function exits /unsuccessfully/ within =legit-from-*=.  However, the invoked =legit-from-*= function can be interrupted with =C-g=.
